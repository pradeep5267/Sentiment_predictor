- A basic sentiment predictor using RNN (LSTM layers)
- Although there is a function for calculating F1 scores, it doesnt work with any other model other than Vanilla LSTM model; needs further digging
- Without F1, the models work but bidirectional LSTM requires a lot of time to compute
- Use the data_explore.py as a scratch pad to perform exploratory data analysis

## download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rX0cxNpGvp7ulincglCX3jq51fEVTHVZ and run the data_explore.py and then sentiment_LSTM.py
